Hmsc-HPC
========

This repository contains the TensorFlow implementation of Hierarchical Modelling of Species Communities (HMSC), serving as an extension to the existing R package, Hmsc-R. The implementation provides a flexible framework for Joint Species Distribution Modelling (JSDM), enabling robust analysis and modeling of species communities.

Contents
--------

* Code (Directory: hmsc/*): contains GPU-compatible implementation of HMSC model fitting algorithm.
* Demo (Directory: examples/basic_example/*): demonstrates the implementation. It serves as a comprehensive guide and example showcasing the functionalities and usage of Hmsc-HPC.
* Data (Directory: examples/big_spatial/*): contains the data and scripts used for performance comparisons presented in the manuscript.

Instructions for Reviewers
